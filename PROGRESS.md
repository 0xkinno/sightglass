# PROGRESS

## P0 (9 Nov 2026)
Done. Platform probes (a) to (d) pass. Evidence: devpost/evidence/PLATFORM_PROBE.md.

Decisions and facts for later phases:
- Project target platform set to Spectacles. Preview device SPECS 27, Interactive input.
- Remote Service Gateway 0.2.0 (not 4.0.0). Import path has spaces: `Remote Service Gateway.lspkg/...`.
- Gemini via RSG answers as gemini-2.5-flash in about 1.6 to 2.0 s. Vision JSON on a drawn dial read 70 bar, correct.
- RSG tokens expire in about one hour. Regenerate with Network.performAuthorizedHttpRequest in ExecuteEditorCode and call project.save() in the same run.
- Do not place the RemoteServiceGatewayExamples prefab.
- The scene has one object, RSG_Credentials, holding the credentials component.

Next: P1 (plan-lens, run by Kinnoski).
